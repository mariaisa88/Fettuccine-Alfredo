      <p><b>"What got you into water coloring?"</b><br><br> "I got into watercoloring media after i took a watercoloring class called understanding landscapes where we made our own sketchbooks and got to sketch nature. I loved how easy it was to blend colors and how freeing it was as an art comparative to acrylic where the paint felt so permanent." </p>

  <div id="draggable7"><div class="container">
      <p><b>"Who are your biggest artistic influences?"</b><br><br> "My biggest influences would be nature. I love painting trees and different types of plants. I would say music has also provided much inspiration as I love painting anything and everything. Mainly inspiration comes from my emotions at the time I begin painting. I like to watercolor as an outlet, so whatever ends up on the page is indicative of how I am feeling about myself/thinking about the word that day." </p>

      <p><b>"What was your favorite project?"</b><br><br> "My favorite project would have to be my boathouse project for the Virginia tech crew team, i designed an underground building, similar to that of an ant farm which focused on this idea of subtraction or the taking away of material within the structure of the building to show spaces. Occupants inside were able to peer through apertures within the walls, ceilings and floors which creating a playful and comradeship-like experience for the team members." </p>

      <p><b>"What is your day like as an architecture student?"</b><br><br> "I am in the studio everyday, monday through friday and spend around 3-7 hours a day. If im not in the studio, im doing other architecture related work for my other classes or working at a construction site with my professor." </p>

  <div id="draggable10"><div class="container">
      <p><b>"Can you tell me a little about some of your watercolor pieces and projects?"</b><br><br> "One of my favorite watercolor pieces was the set of paintings i did of Jim Morrison, Eric Clapton and The Beatles as i focused on listening to their music for hours on end and began to paint them. I felt this was very therapeutic as it was an opportunity for me to learn more personal things about these musicians i love, but also allow myself to represent how they-moreover their musical medium affect me. I feel very strongly about this as music is a big part of my life, i feel as though i am constantly listening to something and it has the ability to change the way i feel. Moreover, it was just a fun thing to do and i enjoyed studying their faces." </p>

  <div id="draggable11"><div class="container">
      <p><b>"What is your process in going out to sketch?"</b><br><br> "I mainly go out on a whim to sketch or watercolor, particularly because i love feeling really motivated to do so. Its nice to be fully committed to making some kind of art and having that be my outing." </p>

  <div id="draggable12"><div class="container">
      <p><b>"What are you most passionate about in architecture?"</b><br><br> "I am most passionate in the discipline and mindset architects carry with them. As architects, we have the power to make others experience spaces that impact them emotionally, physically, mentally, and its our duty to do right by them as not enough places in the US are made for people. People deserve beautiful things, and there are not enough of them." </p>

  <div id="draggable13"><div class="container">
  <p><b>"What motivates you to create?"</b><br><br> "I'm motivated to create as i find much joy and comfort in watercoloring. I know after i do so, im left feeing relaxed and that has become the precedent."<p>
